# goLang_Aligorithms
Implementations of a number of amazing algorithms using goLang

# 1. String Convert to Cammel Case
Complete the method/function so that it converts dash/underscore delimited words into camel casing.
 The first word within the output should be capitalized only if the original word was capitalized
  (known as Upper Camel Case, also often referred to as Pascal case).
Examples

ToCamelCase("the-stealth-warrior"); // returns "theStealthWarrior"

ToCamelCase("The_Stealth_Warrior"); // returns "TheStealthWarrior"

# 2.Stop gninnipS My sdroW!
Write a function that takes in a string of one or more words, and returns the same string, but with all five or more letter words reversed (Just like the name of this Kata). Strings passed in will consist of only letters and spaces. Spaces will be included only when more than one word is present.

Examples: spinWords( "Hey fellow warriors" ) => returns "Hey wollef sroirraw" spinWords( "This is a test") => returns "This is a test" spinWords( "This is another test" )=> returns "This is rehtona test"
